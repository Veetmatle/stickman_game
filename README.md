Hi, the goal was to remake a game I used to play as a kid, using the same graphics and similar idea. 
It was an online game - StickMan RPG. 

My version is more based on speedrun-type game, you have 30 days to acquire 30 lvl in game. 
It's mostly a clicker game, 
however the casino, castle and some quests should be availiable. 
It's only project for fun. 

Unluckily, I'm not great at making graphics, so the game looks as it looks. 
If anyone wants to fork it and give upgrading it a try, feel free to do it. Some mistakes may occur as well - game is still being built. :D
